# Yeartodate_salesdashboard
Created a year-to-date sales dashboard using Power BI
📈🔥 Excited to share my recent project where I created a dynamic sales dashboard using Power BI! Here are some key highlights:
✅ Analyzed total amount, total cost, total profit, and profit percentage, unveiling actionable insights to drive sales growth and profitability.
✨ Leveraged conditional formatting to visually indicate profit target achievement, using "👍" for target met and "👎" for target not met, enhancing data interpretation at a glance.
📊 Utilized table visualizations to showcase salesperson performance, including pictures, total profit, profit percentage, and the achievement of profit targets.
🚀 Empowered decision-making with interactive slicers, allowing team members to filter and explore data specific to their teams, driving collaboration and focus.
💰 Implemented conditional formatting on the second table visualization, highlighting product names based on the total amount, providing immediate visibility to high-performing products.
🎯 Created a visually appealing and user-friendly sales dashboard that enables intuitive data exploration, helping teams identify opportunities and optimize strategies.
